        description: "This section allows the detailed exploration of the aggregated brain datasets on BITHub at the gene level from each individual dataset. The expression values (TPM/RPKM) can be plotted against several metadata attributes. By selecting metadata attributes, users have the ability to determine how gene expression of interest varies with any metadata properties such as phenotype (e.g Age, Sex ), sample characteristic or sequencing metrics. Users also have the ability to filter the data based on region by selecting their region of interest from the ‘Select Brain Region’ drop down menu.A box plot is generated for categorial metadata and a scatterplot is generated for numerical-based metadata. In the case of numerical variables, a second categorical variable can be selected to color the data points. Users can highlight and select a specific portion of the plot to zoom in, and select or deselect specific metadata annotations by clicking on the legend."

        description: "This section allows the detailed exploration of the aggregated single-nucleus datasets on BITHub at the gene from each individual dataset. The CPM expression values can be plotted against several metadata attributes, and users are also able to view cell-type specific expression. A box plot is generated for categorial metadata and a scatterplot is generated for numerical-based metadata. In the case of numerical variables, a second categorical variable can be selected to color the data points. Users can highlight and select a specific portion of the plot to zoom in, and select or deselect specific metadata annotations by clicking on the legend."
